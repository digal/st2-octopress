## Octopress plugin for Sublime Text 2

Note: Plugin assumes that you have your octopress folder opened in the file pane. For now, 'octopress folder' means 'first folder with Rakefile in it' :) 

## Installation 

Drop repo contents to `Packages/Octopress` directory. Normal Sublime package coming soon.

## Commands supported

- `octo_post` ("Octopress: New post" from the command palette) - create new post (ask for title)

## TODO:

- Proper packaging
- Preview
- Deploy
